# FloatingPoints

The goal of this project/internship is to understand the role that floating point numbers play in the world of computer science (mathematical operations). Specifically, we focus on research that addresses the well known problem of lack of accuracy of floating point within computer science mathematics. Our task was to continue an ongoing paper (to be published) that has the end question of finding the probability of associativity within 3 floating point numbers through different combinations and creating a logic statement that encapsulates the associativity of that specific case.

During 2022 Avi Darbari as well as I (Rohan Udupa) worked on the case that included A,B <0 and C> 0.
